# FINAL PROJECT

Here is the final project.
Recently added features are the sign in and sign up in the home view. They are now functionable 
and allow the creation of new users with password confirmation and confirmation email. Logins are available and 
require always a password.
A simple navbar has been added with a router link with a logo, a salute with the username and a signout button.
The newTask component is started with the form.
